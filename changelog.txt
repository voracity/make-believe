R5 (2015-01-03)
- Use node labels (genie: names) when available
- Simple moving nodes (needs much more improvement)
R6
- Backend rewrite to remove dependencies on .xdsl format for BN representation and display
- Extremely experimental .xdsl saving (basic networks only)
R7
- Added experimental worker threads (currently worse perf)
R16
- Right click/context menu triggers CPT dialog
R17
- Fixed entering evidence in first state (should have been 'if undefined' not 'if 0')
- TESTING: Created testing file (makeBelieveTests.js), and added an initial test
- TESTING: Added click-to-update test. Accuracy may be an issue for reproducibility
- TESTING: Added running tests to debug menu
- For very small iterations, worker threads > iterations. Fixed to handle this properly
- Auto-layout is now animated. (Using a slow method --- can be much faster.)
- Auto-layout animation with faster method. :)
- Added a label-only view
- Fixed: [bug] auto-layout, switching between distro/label view sometimes causes arrows to disappear
- Prompt for node delete (in future, undo/redo makes this redundant/undesirable)
- Allowed viewing of equation node definitions
- Allowed setting the equation node definitions (with no validation)
- Added comment reading/viewing from .xdsl file
- Allow changing text in comments
- Save comment to .xdsl file
- Fixed decision network evaluation bustage (broken since had switched to worker threads as default)
- TESTING: Added a simple regression test for decision networks
- Very preliminary add node capability (backend only)
- Arc weights based on % mutual info for children
R18
- Fixed worker-based inference, when changes have been made to network
- Support for .dne comments
- Fixed menu markers
- Added support for node colours and formats
	- Read in from .xdsl files
	- Fix editing of formatting controls
	- Save format changes to .xdsl file
	- Added a simple regression test (requires visual verification)
- Probability of Evidence (simple, slow version)
- Added support for the same function-form logical operators as GeNIe (And, Or, etc.). No "Not", because there's none in GeNIe.
- Support for further functions (arithmetic)
R19
- Initial group support
	- Show only nodes from currently focused group
	- Show node for submodel, with arcs
	- Allow submodel navigation
	- Allow moving with submodel
	- |display()| function clean up
	- Fixed up pathsIn/pathsOut to store information as objects rather than arrays
	- Delete now working again
- Context menus supported (minimally) on utility and decision nodes now
R20
- Can (properly) flatten a network with submodels (but this is a non-reversible change, rather than a different view)
- Can move nodes from one submodel to another, by changing it's 'path'
- Made 'type' visible on context menu (need to make changeable ... somehow)
- Added 'label' to the context menu
- Made context menus available on submodels
- Possible to change ID and label on submodel nodes
- Code: .submodelPath vs .path (the latter includes id of the submodel itself). Eliminated .path
- Can view submodel path, and move submodels to different submodels from context menu
- Show arc strengths fixed, and can be used with BNs containing submodels (I'm not clear that the approach I've chosen is sensible, though, which is sum(mi)/sum(child-entropies) for all applicable paths)
- FIXED: Significant contextmenu dialog duplication. PART FIXED: Now fix node context menu
- FIXED: Continuous nodes/networks seem to have broken.
- FIXED: .dne support broken
R21
- Added bars (bar graphs) to CPT cell background
- Changed CPTs to display 'chances'
- Check for valid CPT on change
- API: Allow adding states
- API: Allow deleting states
- API: Allow renaming states
- API: Centralise new Node/addNode code
- Can rename states from CPT context menu

Bugs
- Submodel issues:
	- 'item' refers to node and submodel items. Should I move to more generic 'node' for both? Without affecting inference...
Creating nodes
	- Double click to add node to canvas (done)
	- Rename node and state names (content editable?)
	- Add and delete states
- addStates/deleteStates: Update child CPTs (if they have CPTs)
- Move the visible graph creation logic out of the display() function
- Allow switch to flat view and back (how to handle layouts for both group and flat view?)
- Handle node type changes**
- Create proper compile function (start with loadPostprocess). Should probably 'fix' representational errors.
- Style comment in node context dialog

Features
- Continuous evidence...
